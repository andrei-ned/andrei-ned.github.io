			<p>Taro and Ferdy is one of my earliest projects and I'm really passionate about it. The game started as our entry to <a href="https://www.jaromania.org/noutati/elevii-de-liceu-inoveaza-industria-jocurilor-video-in-competitia-gamecelerator-5-0">Gamecelerator 5.0</a>, a local game dev competition. We managed to win, and as a reward we were given the privilege of working on our game in <strong>Ubisoft</strong> Bucharest's office for 3 weeks, a professional working environment.</p>

				At the core of the design sit the 2 characters, which you control simultaneously: Taro and his bird friend Ferdy. Each have different, complementing mechanics. Ferdy can fly and be positioned as a platform for Taro. All other mechanics are built around this, what each character can or can't do. Taro can can push boxes or flick levers, you need to get him to the end of a level in order to progress. Ferdy can freely fly, and rest on a pressure plate in an otherwise unreachable spot. This creates some interesting puzzles, as you need to figure out how to activate switches, while also allowing Ferdy to be a crutch for Taro's mobility. The game unfolds around this core mechanic.

			<p>I've solved many problems working on the game, for example, the physics between the 2 characters took several code iterations to implement seamlessly. Designing levels is also challenging, but satisfying, as I like to teach and fully explore mechanics with clever level design. Playtests were key in making tweaks, and making the game more intuitive without compromising on challenge.</p>
